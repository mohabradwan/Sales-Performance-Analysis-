# Sales-Performance-Analysis-

This project involved gathering data from the Salesbazz CRM system to calculate incentive values for each individual based on KPI metrics. Additionally, an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) was conducted to derive recommendations and identify areas for future exploration.

Overview
The project steps included:

Data Gathering:

Data was extracted from the CRM system, Salesbazz, containing relevant information required for incentive calculation.
Incentive Calculation:

Based on specific KPI metrics, the incentive value for each person was calculated.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

A comprehensive EDA was performed on the collected data to uncover trends, outliers, and key insights.
The analysis led to recommendations for improvement and potential areas to further explore.
Tech Stack
Python: For data manipulation and analysis.
Pandas: For data processing.
Matplotlib/Seaborn: For visualizations.
Jupyter Notebooks: For conducting the analysis.
Key Components:
KPI-based Incentive Calculation:

Custom formulas based on predefined KPIs were applied to calculate individual incentives.
EDA:

The analysis aimed to understand the data structure, identify patterns, and derive actionable insights.
Recommendations & Future Aspects:

The results from EDA led to specific recommendations for improving performance.
Additional areas were identified for further exploration and analysis.
Prerequisites:
Python 3.x
Required libraries: pandas, matplotlib, seaborn (install via pip install -r requirements.txt)
